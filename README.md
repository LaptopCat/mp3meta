# MP3META
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/gcottom/mp3meta/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/gcottom/mp3meta?branch=main)

mp3Meta is an adapter for Bogem's id3v2, licensed under the MIT license, link in Acknowledgements. This library provides a common interface that is used by my [AudioMeta v3](github.com/gcottom/audiometa/v3) library to read and write MP3 related metadata. 

## Acknowledgements
- [id3v2](github.com/bogem/id3v2/v2) - Bogem's id3v2 library is the magic behind the mp3 portion of AudioMeta v3. Thank you Bogem for this amazingly useful lib.
